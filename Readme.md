Hello Everyone ,

We will be building  a global command line application using Node.js. 
It organizes all your files from from a folder into different section  so that you need not to do it manually.

We will be using all the concepts we have learned so far in JavaScript and Nodejs like
* Switch case
* Help function
* Organize function
* Tree function


Hope  you all enjoy it.
